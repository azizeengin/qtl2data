The detailed SNP array data for Gatti et al (2014) are available at
the Mouse Phenome Database:
<http://phenome.jax.org/db/q?rtn=projects/projdet&reqprojid=289>

The R script in this directory,
[`grab_XYintensities.R`](grab_XYintensities.R), extracts the array
intensities for SNPs on the X and Y chromosomes and saves them as CSV
files. It assumes that you've already downloaded and extracted the
`Gatti_2014.zip` file.

- The X intensities are in [`Gatti2014_Xint.csv`](Gatti2014_Xint.csv).
- The Y intensities are in [`Gatti2014_Yint.csv`](Gatti2014_Yint.csv).
